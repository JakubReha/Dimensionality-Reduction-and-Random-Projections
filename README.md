# Dimensionality Reduction and Random Projections
http://users.ics.aalto.fi/ella/publications/randproj_kdd.pdf

1. Implement the methods discussed in the paper: RP, SRP, PCA, and DCT.
2. Build a collection of datasets by searching the internet. Try to find the datasets in the original
paper and search for one additional dataset from each category: image, text, other. Try to
include new datasets that are larger than the ones in the original paper.
3. Evaluate the different methods on the data you collected with respect to running time and
approximation error.
4. Discuss whether the results of the paper are reproducible in your experiments, and whether they
generalize to the new datasets you tested.
5. Discuss the original paper in terms of approach, methodology, and conclusions.
6. Summarize the most interesting things that you learned in this project.
