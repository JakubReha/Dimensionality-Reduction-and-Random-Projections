# Dimensionality Reduction and Random Projections
http://users.ics.aalto.fi/ella/publications/randproj_kdd.pdf

1. Implement the methods discussed in the paper: RP, SRP, PCA, and DCT.
2. Build a collection of datasets by searching the internet. Try to find the datasets in the original
paper and search for one additional dataset from each category: image, text, other. Try to
include new datasets that are larger than the ones in the original paper.
3. Evaluate the different methods on the data you collected with respect to running time and
approximation error.
4. Discuss whether the results of the paper are reproducible in your experiments, and whether they
generalize to the new datasets you tested.
5. Discuss the original paper in terms of approach, methodology, and conclusions.
6. Summarize the most interesting things that you learned in this project.

**Written Report**

Your PDF should be submitted through Canvas (a single copy per group) by the deadline. The report should be at most 7 pages including references, images, and
tables. In addition, the report should have *a (single) cover page with title, group number, author list,
and short abstract (it does not count to the upper limit of 7 pages).* 

In the report, you should first in the *Introduction describe the article in such a level of detail that your peer students in this course understand the method, and so that it is clear to the reader that you understand the method too*  You can put it in a wider context of the more recent state-of-the-art work
that is built on the original contribution. Towards the end of the introduction, you should clearly and
concisely outline the scope and objectives of your project.

You should then present your re-implementation or extension of the method in the Methods section, and your reproduction of the results in the Results section. Again, please communicate on such a level that your peer students understand what you have done, and so that it is clear to the reader what
results you got and if, how, and why they deviate from the results presented in the original article.

Alternatively, if you extended or modified the original method please state clearly the motivation and your reasoning behind it, and describe how your results relate to those in the original paper.

Finally, you should critically discuss the methods and findings included in your report. Please, argue in favor and against the method in relation to the authors’ arguments and their line of reasoning. In this Discussion section please provide a wider context potentially taking into account more recent
developments built on the original contributions made in the paper (or as a countermeasure to these original contributions).

All statements made in the report (e.g., “method X is better than method Y”) should be supported by either a reference to the original paper or report where the statement was made or if the statement originates from you, you should explain why this statement is true. If you make a quantitative comparison, please support your findings with appropriate statistical evidence (in the spirit of statistical hypothesis testing).
